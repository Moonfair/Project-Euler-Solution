# Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P_n = n(3n-1)/2.
# The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

# 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

# It can be seen that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their
# difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

# Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their
# sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P_k - P_j| is minimised;
# what is the value of D?
